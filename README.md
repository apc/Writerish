# Writer-ish: Emacs themes

Two simple Emacs themes that aim to recreate the look of [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer). Very much a work in progress. 

(Note: The now well-known Focus mode could be added by using something like [Focus](https://github.com/larstvei/Focus).)

## Origins

The light variant started out as a fork of [Berrys](https://github.com/vbuzin/berrys-theme). A few commits later, I added a few colors, changed others, and tweaked things enough I thought it might be worth giving my fork a different name. I also ended up adding a dark variant, also inspired by [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer)'s dark theme.

For a look even closer to the original, you may choose to install one of [the typefaces](https://github.com/iaolo/iA-Fonts) available in [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer), kindly made available by their creators free of charge.

You can do with this what you want.
