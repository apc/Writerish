# Writer-ish: Emacs themes

Two simple Emacs themes that aim to recreate the look of [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer).

## Origins

The light variant started out as a fork of [Berrys](https://github.com/vbuzin/berrys-theme). A few commits later, I added a few colors, changed others, and tweaked things enough I thought it might be worth giving my fork a different name. I also ended up adding a dark variant, also inspired by [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer)'s dark theme.

For a look even closer to the original, you may choose to install one of [the typefaces](https://github.com/iaolo/iA-Fonts) available in [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer), kindly made available by their creators free of charge.

You can do with this what you want.

## Pending

The now well-known Focus mode could be added by using something like [Focus](https://github.com/larstvei/Focus). 

The look of the mode-line is still not quite what I want. I may revisit that at some point.

One of the colors used in the theme seems like a poor fit---I don't quite know what to use instead.

Other things may need to change too. This is just a first try.
